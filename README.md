# Hospital-Beds-Management

## Overview:
This project analyzes patient admissions, staffing levels, and bed space allocation across hospital departments using Microsoft Power BI. The goal was to uncover patterns in bed utilization, admission rates, and patient satisfaction to improve hospital resource management and service delivery.

## Process & Tools:
Using Power Query, the dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency across patient, staff, and service records. Power BI was then used to create interactive dashboards that visualized trends in admissions, staff availability, and satisfaction rates across different departments.

## Tools & Technologies: 
- Power BI | Power Query | Excel (CSV Dataset)

## Dataset Source: Kaggle – Hospital Beds Management

## Outcome:
- The final dashboard provides actionable insights into how hospital resources are allocated
- Help healthcare administrators make data-driven decisions to reduce patient wait times
- Improve staff efficiency, and enhance overall service quality.
